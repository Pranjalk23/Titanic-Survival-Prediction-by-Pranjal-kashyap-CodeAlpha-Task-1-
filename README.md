# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-by-Pranjal-kashyap-CodeAlpha-Task-1-

This repository contains a project developed as part of a data science internship at **CodeAlpha**. The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for binary classification problems in machine learning. In this project, we analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, and build predictive models to determine whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Titanic competition. It contains the following key features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Fare**: Ticket fare.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).

The dataset is divided into training and testing datasets:
- **train.csv**: Used to train and validate models.
- **test.csv**: Used to test the final model predictions.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or an IDE like VSCode
- Key Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
- Visualizing and summarizing data to understand relationships and patterns.
- Identifying missing values and outliers.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing data.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical features.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

### 4. Model Building
- Training multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Selecting the best-performing model for prediction.

### 6. Deployment
- Exporting the trained model for use in a web application or script.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
